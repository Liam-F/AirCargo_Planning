Implement a Planning Search
===========================

In this project, I will solve deterministic logistics planning problems for an Air Cargo transport system using a planning search agent. I will start by defining a group of air cargo domain problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) fashion, and then I will set up the problems for search, experimenting with various automatically generated heuristics to solve the problems. This project is part of the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) program, from Udacity.
